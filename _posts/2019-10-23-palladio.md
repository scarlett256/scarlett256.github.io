title: Palladio Review
---

  Palladio is a tool which allows its users to visualize complex historical data through visuals of maps and various forms of graphs. I found the site to be fairly easy to pick up. When I came back to play with it some more, I used a sample set of data and was able to use tutorials and FAQs on the site to figure out how everything worked. I found it really useful that, when mapping, I could make connections between the dots (in this case, birthplace and place of death) and then create another layer that would make all of the birthplace points and certain color in order to make them standout. This made reading the graph a lot easier and could be used in other projects in order to color-code points that are important.
